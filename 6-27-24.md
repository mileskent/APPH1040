Exams will be MC etc.

Most common affliction is headache -> "**Cephalgia**"
"Ceph" -> head
"algia" -> pain

Brain highly vascular

Migraine comes from vasospasms

"Leg" is knee to foot, Pelvis to knee is thigh

Posterior/Anterior

### Tendons vs Ligaments

Tendon -> muscle to bone
Ligaments -> bone to bone

Injure ligament -> sprain
Injure muscle/tendon -> strain

Muscles heal faster than ligaments

Repeated injury/microtears in ligament, like repeated ankle sprains, results in haphazard ligament repair, AKA scar tissue. Want to start moving joint in direction it is meant to move to try to prevent scar tissue, i.e. PT.
### Reflex Reaction
* Sensory input through back of spinal cord motor control out through front of spinal cord
* Kneecap "patella" ligament is free floating in tendons and ligaments
* Patellar ligament (which is attached to tibia) is tapped, shortens patella ligament which pulls patella down, stretches tendon above patella which stimulates stretch receptors in above muscle which triggers sensory neurons, sensory neurons go into spinal cord, sends signals to motor neurons which triggers muscles to contract
* Another example is tricep tendon which makes arm extend
* If the response is a spasm rather than a reflex that indicates an issue

# Human Digestive System
*Do not need to know everything covered in this section or the cardio one, there will be a study guide for these sections*

### Functions of Digestive System
* Ingest food
* break down food into nutrient molecules
* Absorb molecules into the bloodstream
* Rid the body of the waste

Chewing -> "**Mastication**"
Swallow -> "**Deglutition**"
Urinate -> "**Micturate**"

### Main Division of Digestive System
* **Alimentary Canal** = Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract
	* Muscular tube through body
	* Digests food and absorbs food particles
	* Mouth, Pharynx, Esophagus, Stomach, Small and Large intestines
* Accessory Digestive Organs
	* Teeth, Tongue, Gallbladder, Salivary Glands, Liver, Pancreas
	* Food does not go through, but they contribute to the digestive process

Diagnosed colon cancer means that the cancer has been developing for around 10 years

### Digestive Processes
* Ingestion
* Propulsion
	* *? How is this different from deglutition*
* Mechanical digestion
* Chemical digestion
* Absorption
* Defecation

### Veins vs Arteries
**Veins** are superficial and on the surface, little pressure
**Arteries** and deeper and carry more blood -> bleed more, a lot of pressure

Bruise = "**Hematoma**"
### GI tract histology
**Lumen** is the very inside of the tract that the food actually touches, same term applies to blood vessels
1. **Mucosa** is the first layer and absorbs nutrients, single layer of cells
2. **Submucosa** makes substances that excreted into tract
3. **Muscularis** Layer that contracts and propels food through tract, involuntary
4. **Serosa** is very outer layer, like sausage casing

### Mouth Anatomy
* Submandibular gland= the salivary glands under tongue
	* Salivary amylase is enzyme in saliva
* Tongue pushes food to back of throat
* Uvula 
* Tonsils
### Enzymes vs Sugars
enzymes end in ase
sugars end in ose
Lactase breaks down lactose
Lactose intolerant means insufficient lactase
Sucrose is Fructose + Glucose, broken down by Sucrase
### Anatomy of Salivary Glands
3 salivary glands on each side of head
**Salivary amylase** breaks down starches into simpler sugars
**Starch digestion begins in the mouth**
Saliva mostly water, mucin, salivary amylase

### Anatomy of Esophagus
Bolus of food pushed down into stomach
**Peristalsis** is the wavelike contraction moving food
### Deglutition and the Pharynx
When you swallow, the bolus catches on the epiglottis cartilage which bends over the airway and routes the bolus into the esophagus
Epiglottis only works when conscious and awake
Glottis -> Trachea

### Stomach
- Lesser and Greater curve
- 3 layers in different directions
- Mechanical and chemical digestion
- Sphincter at top and bottom
- Lots of folds which have specialized cells
- turns bolus into "chyme"
- Mucosa, Submucosa, Muscularis, Serosa layers
- Mucus layer protects from hydrochloric stomach acid
- **Goblet cells** make mucus and look like goblet
- **Parietal** cells make hydrochloric acid (HCl) and **intrinsic factor** which is neccessary for absorbing vitamin $B_{12}$
* **Chief** cells makes pepcinogen which is converted into pepsin, which breaks down proteins
	* -gen -> creation
	* In order to create pepcin you need HCl and pepcinogen
* **Protein digestion begins in the stomach**
* **Enteroendorcine** cells release hormones
	* Histamine, Serotonin, Gastrin, Endorphins, Somatostatin
* Pyloric sphincter allows ~ 3 mL of chyme out of the stomach at a time in intervals



### Small Intestine
**Fat digestion begins here**
Duodenum -> Small intestine
Jejunim, Ileum -> Top and bottom of small intestine
Villi -> fingerlike projections in the small intestine, which the point is to increase surface area, for absorbing nutrients
Microvilli -> make sucrase, nuclease (breaks down nucleaic acid, e.g. DNA), aminopeptidase (breaks down amino acids)

### Liver
Largest internal organ
Starts below the pecs, lies slightly above the stomach
Functions:
* **Filters and/or processes** blood of 
	* carbs, proteins, lipids from intestines
	* drugs and hormones
* Makes and regulates cholesterol
* Makes bile, which emulsifies fats
	* bile goes into the small intestine
	* Heme is involved in making bile
	* stored in the **gallbladder**
		* Gallbladder is connected to liver
* Storage of vitamins and minerals
* Everything goes into the liver through the portal vein
* All GI blood goes into the liver

### Spleen
Breaks down red blood cells
Not essential to living
Right under diaphragm
Lymphatic
### Pancreas
Pancreas behind stomach
Makes enzymes
Bicarbonate

### Large Intestine / Colon
Reabsorption of water and electolytes from liquid chyme
Lots of bumps "Haustra"
Muscle spanning whole colon
Makes Vitamin K which is for blood clotting
Makes Vitamin B

### Terms
* Ulcers, gastric of duodenal
	* Caused by NSAIDS, stress and HCl hypersecretion
	* NSAIDS -> Nonstreoidal Antiinflammatory drug, i.e. ibuprofen
* Cirrhosis is scarred liver due to chronic inflammation
* Hepatitis is liver inflammation: viral, cancer, alchohol
* Biliary Calculi: gallstones
	* Crystals of chloesterol in bile
* Renal Calculi: Kidney stone
* Borborygmus
	* Rumbling noise caused by gas though intestines
* Cholecystitus: inflammation of gallbladder
* Colitis: inflammaiton of colon
* Dysphagia: difficulty in swallowing
* Enteritis: inflammation of intenstines
* Flatulence
* Eructation: Burp
