	* High PSA levels in blood are indicative of prostate cancer
	* 0 - 2.5 ng/ml normal levels
* Digital Rectal Exam

As we get older, blood pressure naturally increases due to calcium build up in veins, i.e. older people needed a higher blood pressure in order to reach the same level of effective hypertension as a younger person

Disease is outside of the normal homeostatic ranges (ease is within it)

### Wellness

Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, Spiritual, Social, Environmental

5. Feces

There is a 6th F that we have omitted, related to STD's

If you go to the doctor and there is no diagnosis produced, your condition is "idiopathic", meaning "unknown cause".

Epidemiology $\rightarrow$ the study of what is upon the people 
* study of distribution and determinants of disease frequency in human populations

Public health is typically divided into epidemiology,  
biostatistics and health services. Environmental,  
social, behavioral and occupational health are also  
important subfields.  
There are 2 distinct characteristics of public health:  
1. It deals with preventive rather than curative aspects  
of health  
2. It deals with population-level, rather than individual-  
level health issues
