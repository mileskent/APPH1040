# Cardiovascular System

### Heart
* In between the lungs in the *mediastinum*
* above diaphragm
* About size of clenched fist
* Point of the heart on the bottom is the *apex*
* *Base* -> the top bulk
* Cardiac Muscle
* Double pump -> right and left
	* Right is receiving, "Pulmonary", deoxyginated blood into the lungs
	* Left is emitting, "Systemic", oxygenated blood to the body, thicker muscle

#### Chambers
*Will be spelled out in the study guide*
* 4 Chambers
* Atria
	* Right atrium
	* left atrium
	* Interatrial septum
	* Fossa ovalis
* Ventricles
* RIght venricles
* Left ventricle
* Interventiruclar septum

#### Valves
* Atrioventricular valves
	* Tricuspid
	* Bicuspid (mitral)
* Semilunar valves
	* Pulmonary semilunar
	* Aortic semilunar
* Associated Structures
	* Chordae tendinae
	* Papillary muscles
#### Microscopic Anatomy
* Fine striations running through cardiac muscles
* Intercalated discs
	* Links together cardiac muscle cells
	* Allows cardiac muscles to contract in coordination

#### Respiration
* Intercostal muscles (muscles between ribs) -> Accessory muscles to breathing
* Diaphragm also helps

#### Pulmonary Circulation
* ***Arteries always carry blood away from the heart***
	* A for artery, A for away
	* Veins opposite
* Atrium is a chamber where blood enters the heart
	* latin: entrance hall
* Ventricle pushes blood, shaped like V

* Superior and inferior vena cava
* Right atrium
* Tricuspid
* Right Ventricle
* Pulmonary Semilunar
* Pulmonary valve and artery
* Lungs
* Pulmonary veins
* left atrium
* Bicuspid valve
* left ventricle
* aortic semilunar
* systemic aorta
* Coronary artery

#### Coronary Circulation
* Left coronary artery
	* Coronary meaning "crowning" vessels on the top of the heart
* ***Left Anterior Descending Artery*** (LAD)
	* Most important vessel
* Right coronary artery
* Arterial anatomoses


No Guide after here -------------------------------------------------------------

#### Cardiac Output
*Cardiac Output* = the amount of blood (volume) pumped by each ventricle per minute
*Stroke volume* = the volume of blood pumped by a ventricle in a single beat
$CO = SV * HR$
* 60 - 100 bpm is typical resting HR
* Avg SV is 70 mL / stroke

#### Capillaries
Artery -> Vein transition with the smallest blood vessels
* Constant inward pressure to blood vessels
* Decreasing pressure as you go further from the heart (source of BP)
* Net pressure flips from outward to inward
* Fluid that has exited from blood vessels dealt with by Lymphatic System

### Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
* Congestive Heart Failure
* Hypertension
* Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)
* Atherosclerosis
* Organs affected
	* Brain
	* Eyes
	* Kidneys
	* Extremities
* Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
	* Condition where the coronary arteries are narrow or blocked
	* Heart Attack -> ***"Mycardial Infarction (MI)"***
		* Tissue death (infarction) to part of the heart muscle (myocardium) due to insufficient blood flow
	* Angina
		* Chest pain or discomfort cause by restricted blood supply to the heart

#### Symptom vs Sign
A sign is an objective thing that can be measured or observed
A symptom is a subjective experience or feeling reported by a patient

#### Heart Electrical Activity
* P -> Atria
* QRS -> Ventricles
* T -> Reset

### Hypertension
* Device -> Sphygmomanometer (Sphygmo-manometer)
	* Sphygmo -> Pulse
* 1/3 Adults have hypertension in the US
* The sound is called the "Korotkoff" sound
* Reads off of the Brachial artery
* First sound marks the systolic pressure
	* The pressure it took for left ventricle to overcome pressure of the cuff
	* Pressurized ventricle pressure
* Second is diastolic
	* Noncontracted ventricle pressure
* Systolic/Diastolic

### AHA Chart

| Classification       | Systolic  |           | Diastolic |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Good                 | <120      | ***and*** | <80       |
| Elevated             | 120 - 129 | ***and*** | <80       |
| Stage 1 Hypertension | 130 - 139 | ***or***  | 80 - 89   |

### Stroke or Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)
* Brain cell injury due to blockage or rupture of blood vessels
* Due to atherosclerosis

### Cholesterol
* Chylomicrons are how the body packages cholesterol and fats
* Liver processes Chylomicrons into "Very low density lipoprotein" (VLDL), which gets converted into "Low density lipoprotein" (LDL), aka "Bad cholestrol", aka L cholesterol
* High density lipoprotein (HDL) is "Healthy cholesterol", H for healthy
	* Picks up loose cholestertol throughout the body and brings it back to the liver
* High HDL Low LDL ideal
* Total cholesterol: <200 mg / dL good
* LDL: < 100 mg / dL good
* HDL: > 40 mg / dL good, >60 mg / dL best
* Triglycerides (fats in general): < 150 mg / dL good

* Hyperlipidemia: High fat blood levels
	* Hyper - high
	* lipid - fat
	* emia - presence in blood
* Familial hypercholesterolemia
	* Genetic high levels of cholesterol in blood
