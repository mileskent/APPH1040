Alcohol is chemically known as ethanol
7 cal / g
Product of fermentation
Yeast convert pyruvate (product of glycolysis)  
into alcohol and carbon dioxide  
Beer is produced using malting cereal grain  
Wine is produced by fermenting grapes  
Distilled spirits are produced by distillation  
which separates liquids yielded from  
fermentation

### Production of Alcohol
Glucose <-> Pyruvate -> Acetadehyde + CO_2

Adetadehyde, NADH, NAD+ -> Ethanol

### Alcohol Processing
* Ethanol goes through the lining of the stomach into the blood
* Moves easily through cell membranes
* Damages cell membrane proteins as it is diffused
* Most damaging effects affect the liver
#### Metabolism
* Gender, race, size, physical condition, stomach contents, ABV, sleep
* **Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)** production 
	* Produced in the stomach
	* Metabolizes alcohol into **acetaldehyde**
* **Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase** + **glutathione**, both made in the liver, attacks acetaldehyde and produces non-toxic **acetate**
* ***Acetaldehyde causes hangover symptoms as glutathione store in liver are used up quickly***
* Women produce less ADH and therefore have more issues processing alcohol

***Legal limit for ABC is 0.08% to drive***

Main liver vein: "Portal" vein

Alcohol excreted by lungs

Blood Alcohol Concentration:
* 0.08 - 0.10% Legally Drunk
* 0.35 - 0.50% Alcohol Poisoning
* >0.50% Coma or Death

### Alcoholism
* Craving
* Impaired control (over self-limiting)
* Physical dependence
* Tolerance

### Alcohol Abuse
Alcohol abuse is a type of drinking that, along  
with the major symptoms of alcoholism, is  
accompanied by one or more of the following  
behaviors within a 12-month period:  
1. Failure to fulfill major work, school, or home responsibilities.  
2. Drinking in situations that are physically dangerous, such as while driving a car or  operating machinery.  
3. Recurring alcohol-related legal problems, such as being arrested while under the  influence of alcohol or physically hurting someone while drunk.  
4. Continuing to drink despite ongoing relationship problems caused or worsened by the effects of alcohol

Alcohol dependence:  
Includes signs of alcohol abuse plus withdrawal  
and tolerance issues.  
Person is addicted at this point

### Alcohol Health Problems
* Interfere with nutrient intake (due to psychological interference)
* Can cause protein and energy deficiencies
* Can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies
* Increases 5 of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. â€“ heart disease, certain forms of cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, motor vehicle and other accidents, and suicides.
* Cirrhosis of liver
* Toxic to Fetus
	* Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
* Brain damage
* Carcinogenic effect
* Hypertension
* Myocardial depression, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy

Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) - Posterior Lobe of hypothalamus
* Levels go down when drinking alcohol

# Stress
