### Immune System
* The body must defend itself against foreign intruders
* Must also deal with abnormal body cells like cancer

Breastmilk does confer immunity
### Innate vs Acquired Immunity
Innate
* Surface Barriers
	* Skin
	* Mucous Membranes
* Internal Defenses
	* Phagocytes
	* Fever
	* NK Cells
	* Antimicrobial Proteins
	* Inflammation
Adaptive 
* Humoral Immunity (Antibodies)
	* B Cells
		* Make Antibodies
		* A Kind of Lymphocyte
* Cellular Immunity
	* T Cells

White Blood Cells engulf Antibody-Antigen Complex

### External Barriers
* Intact skin epidermis
* Acid amntle of skin
* Karatin
* Inact mucous membranes
* Mucus
* Nasal Hairs
* Cilia
* Gastric Juice
* Acid Mantle of Vagina
* Lacrimal Secretion
* Urine
* Oil (Sebum) Secretions

### Internal Defenses
* Lymphatic System
	* Lymph Nodes
		* Filters Lymph
		* Long chains of water filters
		* Filters lymph towards the heart
		* Circulatory System can't have any bacteria
		* White Blood Cells in the Nodes
	* Spleen
	* Appendix

### Infectious disease
Any infection caused microbes or parasites

### Communicable Disease
infection transmitted from persons or animals to other persons

### Terms
Disease: disruption of homeostasis
Pathogenesis: development of evolution of a disease
Sign: Physical manifestations of an illness
Symptom: Subjective and reported by patient
Sequela: outcome of the disease
Etiology: causative agent of the disease
Idiopathic: unknown cause of the disease
Iatrogenic: Inadvertent medically induced effects causing disease or complication
Incubation period: the period of time between exposure to a pathogen and the appearance of the first symptoms of the infection or disease
Prodromal: early symptoms of a disease

Pyrogens - secreted by macrophages and signal
the body to increase temperature; high body
temperature inhibits microbial multiplication and
enhances body repair processes
Main Pyrogen: Endogenis
Interleukin-1
Pyrexia: Fever

### 5 Signs of Inflammation
* Rubor - redness (erythema)
* Tumor - swelling (edema)
* Calor - heat
* Dolor - pain
* Functio laesa - loss of function

### Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
* Prostaglandin (PG's) -> Causes pain, irratation, and swelling at the site of damaged tissue
* NSAID
* Anti-prostaglandin
* Antipyretic
* May cause GI bleeding and stomach upset in chronic use
* Max: 800mg x 4 times / day
* $C_{13}H_{18}O_{2}$
\
### Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
* Pain reliever and fever reducer
* APAP means it contains tylenol
* Paraace**tyl**aminoph**enol**
* Acute overdose can cause hepatotoxicity
* Not an antiplatelet drug like aspirin
* Many OTC Drugs contain tylenol
* 3000 mg / day
* $C_8 H_9 N O_2$
